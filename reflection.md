Why is API documentation important in real projects?

Clear and comprehensive documentation enables developers, both internal and external, to understand an API's functionalities, endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms quickly. This reduces the learning curve and accelerates the integration process, leading to higher adoption rates.
